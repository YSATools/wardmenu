Goals
===

Luke 16:8 - And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.

A lot of research has gone into customer retention, social networking, increasing engagement in a community, etc.

Therefore let us learn from the children of this world and so be wise.

  * Notify when a person enters or exists the ward
  * update member profile
  * encourage seeking inspiration when choosing callings

D&C - Study it out in your mind (not that the data should be the focus,
